    intro: >
      I strive to produce ready-made, tested solutions for reuse and improvement with the help of the collective wisdom 
      of colleagues and others interested. I try to correct errors in existing libraries and frameworks and make 
      improvements to these tools themselves. Often even a corrected description can trigger a wave of corrections in 
      the code itself.
